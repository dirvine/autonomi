# Quantum Security in Autonomi

This guide explains Autonomi's approach to quantum-resistant security and how to implement secure practices in your applications.

## Overview

Autonomi implements a hybrid security approach, combining information-theoretic security for data storage with traditional cryptographic methods for signatures. This guide covers the security features and best practices for maintaining security in your applications.

## Security Features

### Self-Encryption (Information-Theoretically Secure)

Autonomi's self-encryption scheme provides the highest level of security possible:

- Information-theoretically secure chunking (quantum-secure by definition)
- No reliance on computational hardness assumptions
- Secure against both classical and quantum attacks
- Splits data into chunks using information-theoretic principles
- Creates secure data maps for reconstruction
- Implements content-based addressing

### BLS Threshold Signatures (Classical Security)

Our BLS threshold signature implementation provides:

- Classical cryptographic security (not quantum-resistant)
- Distributed key generation
- Threshold signature creation
- Secure aggregation

!!! warning "Quantum Computing Consideration"
    The BLS signature scheme is based on elliptic curve cryptography and will require updates when quantum computers reach sufficient capability. However, the core data storage mechanism using self-encryption chunks remains secure against quantum attacks.

## Implementation Guide

### Secure Data Storage

```rust
use autonomi::{Client, SecurityOptions};

// Configure quantum-secure options
let options = SecurityOptions {
    quantum_resistant: true,
    encryption_strength: EncryptionStrength::Maximum,
};

// Initialize client with security options
let client = Client::init_with_options(options).await?;

// Store data with quantum security
let pointer = client.store_secure(data).await?;
```

### Threshold Signatures

```rust
use autonomi::crypto::bls::{KeyPair, ThresholdScheme};

// Generate distributed keys
let scheme = ThresholdScheme::new(3, 5)?; // 3-of-5 threshold
let keys = scheme.generate_keys()?;

// Create partial signatures
let signature = keys.sign_partial(&message)?;

// Combine signatures
let combined = scheme.combine_signatures(&[signature1, signature2, signature3])?;
```

## Security Best Practices

### Data Protection

1. Always use quantum-resistant encryption for sensitive data
2. Implement proper key management
3. Use secure random number generation
4. Regularly rotate encryption keys

### Network Security

1. Use quantum-resistant TLS
2. Implement secure peer discovery
3. Validate all network messages
4. Use secure routing protocols

### Key Management

1. Use hardware security modules when possible
2. Implement secure key storage
3. Use key derivation functions
4. Regular key rotation

## Quantum Threat Model

### Current Threats

- Shor's algorithm impact on BLS signatures (future consideration)
- Store now, decrypt later attacks (mitigated by information-theoretic security for data)
- Quantum side-channel attacks

### Mitigation Strategies

1. Core data storage is already quantum-secure through information-theoretic security
2. Future upgrade path planned for signature scheme
3. Regular security audits
4. Continuous monitoring

## Implementation Examples

### Secure File Storage

```python
from autonomi import Client, SecurityConfig

# Configure quantum-secure storage
config = SecurityConfig(
    quantum_resistant=True,
    encryption_algorithm="post-quantum-aes",
    key_size=256
)

# Initialize client
client = Client(security_config=config)

# Store file securely
pointer = await client.store_file_secure(file_path)
```

### Secure Communication

```typescript
import { Client, SecureChannel } from '@autonomi/client';

// Create secure channel
const channel = await SecureChannel.create({
  quantumResistant: true,
  protocol: 'quantum-resistant-tls'
});

// Send encrypted message
await channel.send(message);
```
