## Core Features

### Quantum-Secure Storage

Store and retrieve data with post-quantum cryptographic security, ensuring your data remains protected against both classical and quantum attacks.

### Decentralized Architecture

Built on a robust peer-to-peer network that eliminates single points of failure and ensures high availability of your data and applications.

### Real-Time Synchronization

Automatic data synchronization across nodes with conflict resolution, enabling real-time collaborative applications.

### High Performance

Optimized for speed and efficiency with features like connection pooling, batch operations, and streaming support.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Choose your preferred language:

```toml
# Rust
[dependencies]
autonomi = "0.1.0"
```

```bash
# Python
pip install autonomi
```

```bash
# TypeScript/Node.js
npm install autonomi
```

### Quick Start

Initialize a client and start using Autonomi's core features:

```python
from autonomi import Client

# Initialize a client with quantum security enabled
client = Client.init_with_config({
    'quantum_security': True,
    'compression': True
})

# Store and retrieve data
chunk = client.store_chunk(b"Hello, Autonomi!")
data = client.get_chunk(chunk.address)
```

## Core Components

### Chunks

Immutable, quantum-secure data storage units that form the foundation of Autonomi's storage system. Perfect for storing any type of data with guaranteed integrity.

### Pointers

Mutable references that enable version tracking and atomic updates. Ideal for managing changing state in your applications.

### LinkedLists

High-performance transaction chains for building decentralized DAG structures. Great for implementing append-only logs or blockchain-like data structures.

### ScratchPads

Efficient temporary workspaces with CRDT properties. Perfect for collaborative editing and real-time data synchronization.

## Use Cases
